# Parking lot reservation project

## Description

The project presents a parking lot allocation for apartment block residents.
The apartments' administration unit registers the residents and their  information is therefore
saved in their personal user accounts. The user account info contains the resident's name, apartments number, phone number, reservation data, etc.
The user then enters the personal cabinet where they can reserve a parking lot by filling in the plate
number, afterwards the lot is reserved for that particular car plate number and
payable amount is calculated. The user can also terminate the reservation from the system,
after which an invoice will be generated. Given that any third party integrations are in place,
the user can pay the invoice online after which the payable amount from the user account
will be automatically decreased, or the invoice can be paid directly
to the apartments' admin after which in the backoffice application the admin will manually
add the paid amount and the data will be reflected on the user account respectively.
